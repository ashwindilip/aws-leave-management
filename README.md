# AWS Leave Management System

The AWS Leave Management System is a serverless application designed to streamline the process of applying for and approving leave requests within an organization. Leveraging the power of AWS services, this system provides a scalable, reliable, and secure solution for managing employee leave.

## Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Uses JWT tokens to ensure only authorized users can submit leave requests.
- **RESTful API**: Allows easy leave application submission through a simple HTTP endpoint.
- **Automated Workflow**: Implements an approval process with email notifications powered by AWS Step Functions.
- **Persistent Storage**: Stores leave requests securely in Amazon DynamoDB.
- **Email Integration**: Sends notifications and approval requests via Amazon SES.
- **Scalable Design**: Built with serverless AWS components for reliability and scalability.

## Architecture

The system follows a microservices architecture, with each component serving a distinct purpose:

- **API Gateway**: Acts as the entry point, handling incoming HTTP requests and routing them to appropriate Lambda functions.
- **Lambda Functions**:
  - `authorizer`: Validates JWT tokens to authenticate users.
  - `applyLeave`: Processes leave applications, stores them in DynamoDB, and triggers the approval workflow.
  - `sendApproval`: Sends an email to the approver with links to approve or reject the request.
  - `processApproval`: Updates the workflow based on the approver’s decision.
  - `notifyUser`: Emails the user with the final decision.
- **DynamoDB**: Provides persistent storage for leave request data.
- **SES (Simple Email Service)**: Manages email communications for approvals and notifications.
- **Step Functions**: Orchestrates the approval workflow, ensuring each step executes in sequence.

### Workflow

1. A user submits a leave request via a POST request to the API Gateway.
2. The `authorizer` Lambda verifies the JWT token.
3. If authenticated, the `applyLeave` Lambda stores the request in DynamoDB and starts a Step Function execution.
4. The Step Function triggers the `sendApproval` Lambda, which emails the approver with approval/rejection links.
5. The approver clicks a link, invoking the `processApproval` Lambda to update the workflow.
6. The Step Function then calls the `notifyUser` Lambda to email the user with the outcome.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following:

- An AWS account with permissions to create resources (e.g., Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, SES, Step Functions).
- [SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) installed for deployment.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (optional, for local Lambda testing).
- A verified email address in Amazon SES for sending emails (set in `template.yaml` or configured separately).

## Installation

Follow these steps to deploy the application:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ashwindilip/aws-leave-management.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd aws-leave-management
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This installs the required Node.js packages specified in `package.json`.

The SAM CLI can also emulate your application's API. Use the `sam local start-api` to run the API locally on port 3000.

```bash
actual-leave-ashwin$ sam local start-api
actual-leave-ashwin$ curl http://localhost:3000/
```

The SAM CLI reads the application template to determine the API's routes and the functions that they invoke. The `Events` property on each function's definition includes the route and method for each path.

```yaml
Events:
  HelloWorld:
    Type: Api
    Properties:
      Path: /hello
      Method: get
```

## Add a resource to your application

The application template uses AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) to define application resources. AWS SAM is an extension of AWS CloudFormation with a simpler syntax for configuring common serverless application resources such as functions, triggers, and APIs. For resources not included in [the SAM specification](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md), you can use standard [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html) resource types.

## Fetch, tail, and filter Lambda function logs

To simplify troubleshooting, SAM CLI has a command called `sam logs`. `sam logs` lets you fetch logs generated by your deployed Lambda function from the command line. In addition to printing the logs on the terminal, this command has several nifty features to help you quickly find the bug.

`NOTE`: This command works for all AWS Lambda functions; not just the ones you deploy using SAM.

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-api-id.execute-api.your-region.amazonaws.com/Prod/apply-leave \
-H "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "leaveType": "Vacation",
  "startDate": "2023-07-01",
  "endDate": "2023-07-05",
  "approverEmail": "approver@example.com",
  "reason": "Family vacation"
}'
```

### Approval Process

1. The approver receives an email with links to approve or reject the request.
2. Clicking a link updates the request status, and the user is notified of the outcome via email.

## Configuration

The application uses the following environment variables:

- **`JWT_SECRET`**: Secret key for JWT verification (set using `parameter_overrides` in `samconfig.toml`).
- **`SES_EMAIL`**: Sender email address for SES (defined in `template.yaml`, e.g., `ashwin.dilip@antstack.io`—update if needed).
- **`TABLE_NAME`**: DynamoDB table name (auto-set by SAM).
- **`STATE_MACHINE_ARN`**: Step Function ARN (auto-set by SAM).

To change the `SES_EMAIL`, modify the `template.yaml` file before deployment. Ensure the email is verified in SES.

## Monitoring and Debugging

- **Logs**: View Lambda function logs in [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/).
- **Workflow Tracking**: Monitor Step Function executions in the [AWS Step Functions console](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/).
- Ensure your AWS IAM role has permissions to access these services.
